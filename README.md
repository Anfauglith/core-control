## General
This is a simple streamlined cli-based core v2 management script. It can install/update/remove ark core v2 for both mainnet and 
devnet. It can also start/stop the relay/forger or both, and display logs. Using "system info" will show you system information. 
Using "system update" will perform a system dist-upgrade. There is a config.conf file that you normally wouldn't need to touch.
It contains coin-specific variables and should only be changed if you plan to use the tool for a non-ARK core v2 chain.
- Warning: Do not run this tool as root!
