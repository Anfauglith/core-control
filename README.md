## General
This is a simple streamlined cli-based core v2 management script. It can install/update/remove ark core v2 for both mainnet and 
devnet. It can also start/stop the relay/forger or both, and display logs. Using "system info" will show you system information. 
Using "system update" will perform a system dist-upgrade. For start/stop/logs you can also skip the "all" argument as it's the default.
When setting a delegate secret just paste your secret after the "set" argument. You can remove the set secret with the "clear" argument.
- Warning: Do not run this tool as root!
