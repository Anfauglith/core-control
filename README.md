# Core v2 Management Tool

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/geopsllc/core-control
cd ~/core-control/
./core-control.sh [arguments]
Possible arguments:
install mainnet|devnet (Install Core)
update mainnet|devnet (Update Core)
uninstall mainnet|devnet (Uninstall Core)
start relay|forger|all mainnet|devnet (Start Core Services)
stop relay|forger|all (Stop Core Services)
system (Show System Information)
```

## General
This is a simple streamlined cli-based core v2 management script. It can install/update/uninstall ark core v2 for both mainnet and 
devnet. It can also start/stop the relay/forger or both. There is a config.conf file that you normally wouldn't need to touch.
It contains coin-specific variables and should only be changed if you plan to use the tool for a non-ARK core v2 chain.
Using the system argument will now show you system information.
